As of making this data pack, Snowy++, made by Francielly, has not yet been 
updated to 1.18, and Francielly has no plans on updating on updating it, as
she has stopped working on data packs. She has given me the permission to edit
this data pack to comply with 1.18, but she will be credited as the original
creator of Snowy++.
