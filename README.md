# Vanilla Parity Repository
this repo contains alternate versions for the Vanilla Parity Data Pack, including beta builds and the revoked version. The beta builds are experimental and less stable than the full release, so expect things to not work as intended. The Revoked Edition removes the extra Bedrock advancements that were in the original. This is so that you can enjoy your world with other data packs without the advancments cluttering everthing up. The Revoked Edition is linked to the latest original version. For the original version of the pack, see [Vanilla Parity [1.17]](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/vanilla-parity/).
