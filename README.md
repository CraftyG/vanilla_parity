This repository contains alternate versions for the Vanilla Parity Data Pack, including beta builds and the revoked version. The beta builds are experimental and less stable than the full release, so expect things to not work as intended. The Revoked Edition removes the extra Bedrock advancements that were in the original. This is so that you can enjoy your world with other data packs without the advancments being in the way. The Revoked Edition is linked to the latest original version. For the original version of the pack, see [Vanilla Parity [1.18]](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/vanilla-parity/).

**The latest beta only works on 1.18.2, and the revoked version only works in 1.18 respectively.**

## About Vanilla Parity
Vanilla Parity is a data pack designed to resolve some of the parity issues between Minecraft Java and Minecraft Bedrock, where features exist in one edition of the game and not in the other.

**Disclaimer:** Not all features in the issue list are implemented in the data pack. Some features are either hard-coded, inefficient to implement, or missing. This data pack has not been tested for multiplayer, so let me know if there are any bugs that involve multiplayer.
