# Vanilla Parity Repository

[![Version - 2.3.0 BETA](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ver.-2.3.0-%231BD96A)](https://github.com/CraftyG/vanilla_parity/wiki)

This repository solely contains experimental versions of the Vanilla Parity data pack. They are a bit less stable than full releases, so expect things to not work as intended. The Revoked version will not have any experimental versions and will only update once the original is updated first. For the original version of the pack, see [Vanilla Parity [1.19]](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/vanilla-parity/).

## About Vanilla Parity
Vanilla Parity is a data pack designed to resolve some of the parity issues between Minecraft Java and Minecraft Bedrock, where features exist in one edition of the game and not in the other.

**Disclaimer:** Not all features in the issue list are implemented in the data pack. Some features are either hard-coded, inefficient to implement, or missing. This data pack has not been tested for multiplayer, so let me know if there are any bugs that involve multiplayer.
